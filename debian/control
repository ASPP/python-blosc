Description: High performance compressor optimized for binary data (Python 2)
 This package contains a high performance compressor optimized for
 binary data. It has been designed to transmit data to the processor
 cache faster than the traditional, non-compressed, direct memory
 fetch approach via a memcpy() OS call.
 .
 Blosc works well for compressing numerical arrays that contains data
 with relatively low entropy, like sparse data, time series, grids
 with regular-spaced values, etc.
 .
 This is the Python 2 version of the package.
